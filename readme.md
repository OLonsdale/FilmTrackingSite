# MY FILM TRACKING SERVICE

This Single Page web application allows you to create a list of films you have watched, and a list of films you are planning to watch.

It stores the name and metadata of the film as a JSON object, and sorts them into two tables for watching and planning.

A stats page shows some interesting information.

It has a light theme and a dark theme, toggleable with the button at the bottom, and persistant. The default theme is based on your systems prefered theme, and can be persistantly overwritten with the button.

A splash screen shows help the first time the site is loaded.

The films can be copied to the clipboard as a JSON document, and can be imported as the same.

It is fully functional down to 320px width, and will have better styling.

It will get metadata from an API.
