# MY FILM TRACKING SERVICE

This Single Page web application allows you to create a list of films you have watched, and a list of films you are planning to watch.

It stores the name and metadata of the film as a JSON object, and sorts them into two tables for watching and planning.

A stats page shows some interesting information about the films on the list.

It has a light theme and a dark theme, toggleable with the button at the bottom, and persistant. The default theme is based on your systems prefered theme, and can be persistantly overwritten with the button.

A splash screen shows help the first time the site is loaded.

The films can be copied to the clipboard as a JSON document, and can be imported as the same.

It is fully functional down to 320px width, and will have better styling.

Clicking the search button in the add form will fetch data from an API. If the release date is in the future, the entry will default to planning.

Lists can be sorted, and that sorting order will be maintained after adding a new film.
