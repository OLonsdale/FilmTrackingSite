# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

Hello. This has been updated, but leaving the below for reference at a later point.
Currently the site is mostly empty, but all code is my own.

Welcome. This is your assignment repository.

Try to keep it to a maximum of about 300 words.

The description should include a summary of your site content and the primary audience you are targeting.
Also include a brief description of how you have organised the content (a few sentences is fine) for the audience.
Make some specific reference to how you have adapted your site for different screen sizes.

If there are any parts of your code or user interface that need further explanation, you can include that here.
If anything is broken or doesn't quite work properly, you may explain what it SHOULD do.

You must include references (including links) to any external resources/videos/code examples that you have used here.
