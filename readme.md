# MY FILM TRACKING SERVICE

This Single Page web application allows you to create a list of films you have watched, and a list of films you are planning to watch.

It stores the name and metadata of the film as a JSON object, and sorts them into two tables for watching and planning.

A stats page shows some interesting information.

It will get metadata from an API, it will have a light theme and a dark theme, it will allow for importing and exporting of the JSON object.

It is fully functional down to 320px width, and will have better styling


# MY FOUR (virtual) PAGES ARE:

- Watched list

- Planning list

- Add Film Popup

- Statistics

# SITES USED FOR INFORMATION
