# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

# MY FILM TRACKING SERVICE

The goal of this project is to create a service for tracking films you have watched and plan to watch.

You can add a film, a give it a score and add some notes to help you remember what you thought about it.

It will store the information as a JSON cookie, and allow for importing/exporting a JSON file.

Metadata will be retrieved by an API.

It will hopefully have a light and a dark theme.

The menu bar will collapse down to icons when the screen size becomes too small.


# MY FOUR PAGES WILL BE:

- Watched list

- Planning list

- Add film page

- Statistics

# SITES USED FOR INFORMATION
